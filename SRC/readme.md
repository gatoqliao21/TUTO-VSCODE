"But I must explain to you how all this mistaken idea
 of denounciNg pleasure and praising nice was born

i  nice, but because occasionally circumstances occur in 
 which toil and nice can pr
 l example, which of us ever undertakes laborious physical exercise, except to obtain some advantage from
   it? But who has any right to find fault with a man who chooses to enjoy a pl
  easure that has no annoying consequences, or oids a nice that produces no resultant pleasure?"
